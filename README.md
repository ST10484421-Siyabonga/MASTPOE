There are a few changes made to the project, one of those changes were the colour i changed the colour because it was too basic, i mean it was simple but too basic, i added some colour to the project to encourage it's friendliness and ease to use. The first page now has 2 optins or buttons 1 is for the user or a client and another is for the chef, the chefs view is where the chef can edit the prices of meals and confirm orders from and the user or client view is where the user can input their desired meal of choice
